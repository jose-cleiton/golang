What is the primary difference between lists and tuples?

1-You can access a specific element in a list by indexing to its position, but you cannot access a specific element in a tuple unless you iterate
through the tuple.

2-Lists are immutable, meaning you cannot change the data that is inside them once you have created the list. Tuples are mutable, meaning you
can change the data that is inside them at any time.

3-Lists are mutable, meaning you can change the data that is inside them at any time. Tuples are immutable, meaning you cannot change the data
that is inside them once you have created the tuple.

4-Lists can hold several data types inside them at once, but tuples can only hold the same data type if multiple elements are present.
